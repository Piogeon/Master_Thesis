Obtaining the physical composition of NEOs using Machine Learning Approaches
Planetary sciences are a rapidly expanding field of study, especially with the analysis of Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) from a variety of perspectives, including astrobiology, asteroid mining, planetary defence, and many others. For all of these fields, the analysis of NEOs' physical properties is essential. In the past, attempts were made to keep a systematic record of the NEA physical properties data (such as the EARN database at DLR or its migrated version on ESA's NEOCC website), but the difficulty of keeping up with all the available sources for physical properties has prevented the goal from being fully achieved. The objective of this project is to investigate the global sources of information on physical attributes and, if practicable, to create retrieval pipelines to consolidate the data under a single infrastructure, creating the biggest database of NEOs' physical properties. The second part of this research is to determine if the physical composition of NEOs can be constrained by their orbital parameters (a, e, i) and their absolute magnitude H. In order to do this, machine learning methods have been deployed, and it is important to note that the correlation between these two parameters has been established, with more than 100 \% of true positive percentages compared to the classical analysis. This is a significant advancement for research and planetary defence, since the ability to derive the physical composition of an object directly from its orbit will simplify and lower the cost of the procedure.
